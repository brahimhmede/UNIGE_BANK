This Project is a simple Bank APP that contains a registration connected with a FirebaseAUTH account to manage it and save the DATA . Then a Login activity or (Autentication activity ) to take UserDATA to open the home page that contains two buttons : one to refresh or open home screen , and the other one is a Fragment that's called ‘Transfer’ with a specific data ,connected with our DATABASE using SQLite , then a redirecting activity after a successful transfer , and finally  a balance for every account that can be reduced after every transfer and saved ! 
To conclude there is also a logout button ! :)

NOTE: in the gradle we added a Store File that is used when we share the project as APK to be downloaded then the app will 
be considered as trusted app ( or digital signature file )
